# Shots: what's built

`docs/specs/shots/SHOTS.md` (on `feat/earth`) is the plan the producer approved on 2026-11-06. This file says what of it stands on `feat/shots`, how to fly it, and what's left. The first account's list, step 1.

## Step 1: MEGA off, the faction button, the bigger splat

**MEGA off.** No MEGA button, no charge meter, no charge from any press: the HUD's, Space, or a still finger on the screen. A press held any length is a tap when it lifts, and the HOLD cue never comes. `&mega` on a link wakes all of it as it was, the gesture sim's rows included.
- `Input.megaOn` (`src/game/Input.ts`) gates the charge, and `Controls` sets it, with `Hud.megaOn` and the coach's lesson, from `&mega`.
- `src/game/SuperSplat.ts` stays whole, asleep. Its pouring code, the firehose section (`startFirehose`, `stepHose`, `hoseAim`, `impactNow`, `impact`), with `Splatter.barf`'s `hose` and `bands`, is where the Hose starts from. The mega blast's look is what each faction's Bomb III takes.

**The faction button, on links with `?crew`.** The player's faction crest sits at the top left, 44 px, under the notch. It's clear of the canvas's edge band, and far from the bus's lane. A tap opens all five crests in a row under it, the player's rimmed in bus yellow. A tap on one switches at once, and the faction's name shows for a moment. A tap anywhere else closes the row.
- New paint is the new faction's, and paint already down keeps its owner (a later hit by another faction takes it, as the stores have done since factions step 1).
- `src/game/crew.ts` is the player's faction's one source. `main.ts` sets the street's `Splatter.faction` from it, and with it `?moon`'s craters and open ground, and the breath's particles. The flight (`sky/moonrun.ts`) sets `MoonPaint.faction`. `&paintas` still wins for its own page.
- A page on a phone that has seen `?crew` keeps the button there for good, with the last choice (`localStorage` `strugglebus.crew.v1`). Without `?crew` ever seen, nothing changes.
- `crew.locked` is Recess's hook ("In Recess, it works only between matches"). Set, the crest dims, and a tap on it says AFTER THE MATCH.
- The crests are drawn in each faction's own palette rows (`src/ui/crest.ts`): Rainbow's arc, Atlantis's trident over waves, the Elderwood's pine, Hyperglow's bolt, Inferno's flame.

**The bigger splat.** `config.splat.blastRadius` goes from 60 to 85, so a tap from the rooftops paints every building inside 85 m, and from higher up the circle grows as before (twice as wide at 300 m). The building cap now grows with the blast's area: 140 at 85 m (it was 40 at 60 m), up to 240 from high up. Each tap still climbs one level.
- Every blast but a mover's own hit calls `life.blast` with its whole circle, centred on the ground under the impact, so a hit on a tower's roof takes the street at its foot.
- What a circle holds, round 60 random buildings each (median / 90th percentile / most): Alamo Square 57 / 82 / 90 at 85 m, the Sunset 63 / 71 / 75, downtown 30 / 68 / 80. At 60 m the 90th percentile was already 42-43 against a cap of 40. From 300 m up (170 m) the Sunset's 90th percentile is 273 against the 240 cap, so the very highest taps over dense housing still leave a few houses grey.

What it costs, on this laptop's GPU (an Intel UHD 620), in one build, today's numbers against step 1's. Eight blocks round Alamo Square, each tapped three times, the bus held at 160 m:

| | 60 m, 40 a tap | 85 m, step 1 |
|---|---|---|
| Buildings painted | 159 | 242 |
| Draws in the painted view | 108 | 109 |
| Triangles in the painted view | 1.10 M | 1.33 M |
| Of them, the rooftop gardens | 481 K, 24 draws | 712 K, 24 draws |
| The buildings' saved paint | 3.1 KB | 4.8 KB |
| The ground's saved tiles | 8, 43.9 KB | 9, 35.0 KB |

The draws hold. The triangles go up by the gardens alone, and that is where the 1.5 M ceiling is closest: eight blocks at level 3 came to 1.33 M. The gardens' budget (`feat/gardens`) is the answer to that, and this step doesn't touch `src/world/props/sprouts.ts`. On the Moon's paint store (`tools/moon/paint-check.mjs hours`, an hour at Jet) the pictures go from about 9,600 to 14,600, and 14.7 to 18.5 MB of the 64 MB budget.

## How to fly it

The branch's preview: `https://struggle-bus-world-git-feat-shots-patricks-projects-9ff6e721.vercel.app/`
- `?crew`: the faction button. Tap the crest, pick a faction, splat. Then drop `?crew` from the link: the button stays.
- `?crew&life`: the same with the living city. One tap on a park or a busy street paints the people and cars inside the circle.
- `?mega`: MEGA as it was, to compare.

## What's left of step 1

- `life.blast` (the second account's, in `src/life/`) tests a sphere in 3D, so we pass it the ground under the impact: boats and cars in the circle are inside it, and planes overhead aren't. A flat circle on the map, from the ground to the roofs, would say what's meant better.
- A tap that hits a car or a ferry still paints only that mover, not the block round it (SHOTS.md: "A shot that hits a car or a ferry paints the block around it too"). That's the next part of the bigger splat, in `Splat.barfMover`.
- Movers take a hue and a level but no faction (CONTRACT.md: faction 1). Another faction's tap paints them in Rainbow's colours until life takes the hitter's faction.
- The Lift lifts only Rainbow on Rainbow, as FACTIONS.md's first slice built it.
- Nothing here was measured on an A15, or on the producer's phone.
